# Case Study: Funnel Analysis â€“ A/B Testing on User Journey

### Scenario

You are working as a Product Analyst for a startup with a digital product. The company recently launched a new onboarding process (Test group) and wants to compare it to the current version (Control group) to understand its impact on user progression through the funnel.

### Objective

The goal of this analysis is to compare the Control and Test groups across each step of the funnel, detect where users are dropping off, and determine if the new experience improves conversion and retention.

### Tasks

- Visualize the funnel for both Control and Test groups.
- Identify at which step users are most likely to drop off.
- Compare overall conversion and completion rates.
- Analyze time spent per step and differences by age group.
- Deliver actionable insights and recommendations.

### Dataset

The dataset is simulated and includes:
- User IDs and assigned test group
- Completion status for each funnel step
- Time spent per step
- Age group segmentation

### Dashboard

The dashboard was built in Tableau Public and includes:
- Funnel comparison between groups
- Step-by-step completion breakdown
- Error rates and average time per step
- Filters for age and variant segmentation

### Key Insights

- Step 3 shows the highest drop-off for both groups.
- The Test group performs better on Step 2 and Final Confirmation.
- Older users tend to complete the funnel faster on average.
